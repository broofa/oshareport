# The Unofficial OSHA COVID-19 Report Form

## What is this?

This is a streamlined version of the [Oregon OSHA complaint
form](https://www4.cbs.state.or.us/exs/osha/hazrep/), but reworked to make it easier
to report businesses that do not comply with the State's COVID guidelines.

## Why is this a thing?

The official OSHA complaint form isn't designed for COVID complaints.  It's designed for
employees dealing with unsafe work environments.  Broken equipment, bad lighting, lack of
safety gear... that sort of thing.  For COVID issues their form is a bit
cumbersome and confusing.

Providing a better form for COVID complaints makes it easier for anyone, not
just employees, to report businesses that aren't taking the safety of their
employees <em>and the general public</em> seriously.

## Why is this "Unofficial"?

This form page is not maintained by OSHA.  It's just a little weekend project
put together by a concerned citizen.  <strong>It does create official
complaints, however.</strong>  When you hit "Submit", you're creating a real
OSHA report, directly in their system. (You'll be taken to OSHA's site for
 confirmation, by the way.)

## Can I trust this?

Yes... at least to the extent you trust OSHA.  Information entered in this form
is sent directly to OSHA, exactly as it would be if you were doing this thru
their website.

This form does not store, share or otherwise disseminate any information you
provide with third parties.

## I have a question or comment...

Any question or concerns that are not specifically about the technical
implementation of this form should be [sent to OSHA](https://osha.oregon.gov/Pages/contactus.aspx) directly.
