# The Unofficial OSHA COVID-19 Report Form

## What is this?

Briefly, this is a simpler, easier-to-use version of the [Oregon OSHA complaint
form](https://www4.cbs.state.or.us/exs/osha/hazrep/), optimized for creating
reports about businesses not complying with the State's COVID directives.

## Can I trust this?

Yes... at least to the extent you trust OSHA.  Information entered in this form
is sent directly to OSHA, exactly as it would if you were using OSHA's official
site.  This form does not store, share or otherwise disseminate your information
with any third parties.

The source code for this form is available for review and comment at
