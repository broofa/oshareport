# The Unofficial OSHA COVID-19 Report Form

## What is this?

This is a streamlined version of the [Oregon OSHA complaint form](https://www4.cbs.state.or.us/exs/osha/hazrep/), but reworked to make it easier to report businesses that do not comply with the State's COVID guidelines.

## Why is this a thing?

The official OSHA complaint form isn't designed for COVID complaints.  It's designed for employees dealing with unsafe work environments.  Broken equipment, bad lighting, lack of safety gear... that sort of thing.  For COVID issues their form is a bit cumbersome and confusing.

Providing a better form for COVID complaints makes it easier for anyone, not just employees, to report businesses that aren't taking this pandemic seriously.

## Why not just use OSHA's version?

OSHA's version is fine, but can be a bit confusing.  Moreover, this version features a couple improvments that may be of interest:

* Save your contact information.  Check the "Remember my info" checkbox to avoid having to re-enter your personal information each time.
* Share or bookmark a particular business.  Simply enter the Businesss Contact Information, then bookmark the page's URL (or copy/paste it to share with someone) to return to the form with this information already filled in. (The URL is updated automatically as you enter information.)

## Why is this "Unofficial"?

This form page is not maintained by OSHA.  It's just a little weekend project
put together by a concerned citizen.  <strong>It does create official
complaints, however.</strong>  When you hit "Submit", you're creating a real
OSHA report in OSHA's complaint tracking system. (You'll actually end up on their
site once the complaint has been received.)

## Can I trust this?

Yes... at least to whatever degree you trust OSHA.  Information entered in this form
is sent directly to them, exactly as it would be if you were using
their website.

This form does not store, share or otherwise disseminate any information you
provide with third parties.
