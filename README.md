# The Unofficial OSHA COVID-19 Report Form

## What is this?

This is streamlined version of the [Oregon OSHA complaint
form](https://www4.cbs.state.or.us/exs/osha/hazrep/), designed to make it easier
to report businesses that do not comply with the State's COVID guidelines.

## Why is this a thing?

If a business fails to enforce basic COVID guidelines, their patrons have little
in the way of recourse.  According to the State, OSHA is responsible for
enforcement, however the existing form for submitting conerns is simply not
designed for this purpose.  It's oriented more toward employees that need to
bring attention to common workplace safety issues, and is unnecessarily complex
and unintuitive.  By providing a better experience, it is hoped people will be
more willing to file issues and, thus, bring more attention to unsafe
conditions.

## Can I trust this?

Yes... at least to the extent you trust OSHA.  Information entered in this form
is sent directly to OSHA, exactly as it would be if you were entering
information directly on OSHA's site.  This form does not store, share or
otherwise disseminate any information with third parties.
