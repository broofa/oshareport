# The Unofficial OSHA COVID-19 Report Form

## What is this?

This is a streamlined version of the [Oregon OSHA complaint
form](https://www4.cbs.state.or.us/exs/osha/hazrep/), but reworked to make it easier
to report businesses that do not comply with the State's COVID guidelines.

## Why is this a thing?

The official OSHA complaint form isn't designed for COVID complaints.  It's designed for
employees dealing with unsafe work environments.  Broken equipment, bad lighting, lack of
safety gear... that sort of thing.  For COVID issues their form is a bit
cumbersome and confusing.

Providing a better form for COVID complaints makes it easier for anyone, not
just employees, to report businesses that aren't taking this pandemic seriously.

## Why is this "Unofficial"?

This form page is not maintained by OSHA.  It's just a little weekend project
put together by a concerned citizen.  <strong>It does create official
complaints, however.</strong>  When you hit "Submit", you're creating a real
OSHA report in OSHA's complaint tracking system. (You'll actually end up on their
site once the complaint has been received.)

## Can I trust this?

Yes... at least to whatever degree you trust OSHA.  Information entered in this form
is sent directly to them, exactly as it would be if you were using
their website.

This form does not store, share or otherwise disseminate any information you
provide with third parties.
